# Differential_attack

Linear and Differential Cryptanalysis.

I implemented a simple and weak chiper in MAGMA. Afterwards, I implemented a two types of attack, linear and differential, that break this chiper easily using Boolean function knowledge. The attack is of kind partial-key-recovery.

The implementation is based on the paper of M. Heys.
